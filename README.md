This is a tool that works by inputting a spreadsheet of a given format (example spreadsheet included and named as "dataSheet.xlsx") and performing a search through an intuitive UI that allows you to filter out projects. The tool allows for data visualisation prior to the creation of the document and facilitates the choice of both document orientation and size. 

**Use this app following the steps below:**

- `Select a spreadsheet` - Import the data file you want to search through. 
- `Perform your search` - Type in keywords and click on the autogenerated suggestions or use the dropwdown boxes below to perfrom a search.
- `Review results and choose document settings` - Check that those are the results you are looking for and choose between size and orientation.
- `Import template folder` - Select your "templates" folder. You are encouraged to make changes to the templates and see how they change your document style.
- `Generate document` - Choose where you would like to save your file and you should be able to find it there after a verification pop up.
